# Live_Feed_raspberry_pi
This is the code that allows one to see a live feed using a Raspberry Pi and a Pi camera only
In this code, a window appears showing the live feed. It is exited when 'q' is pressed.
An additional feature is added that the last frame of the Livefeed is captured in this process.
